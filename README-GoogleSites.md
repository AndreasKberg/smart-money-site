# Smart Money Smarts — Google Sites migration

Files added to this repo (main branch):
- /assets/favicon.svg — small favicon you can download and upload to Sites
- /assets/og-image.svg — social preview image (1200x630)
- /assets/Beginner-Finance-Guide.html — web-friendly guide you can paste or convert to PDF
- /assets/Beginner-Finance-Guide.pdf — placeholder: replace with your final PDF
- robots.txt and sitemap.xml — helpful for static hosts

Next steps for you:
1. Review and, if happy, let me push these files to your repo (I'm doing that now).
2. Upload the PDF and OG image to Google Drive and set sharing to "Anyone with link can view".
3. Create a Google Form and embed it in the Contact page.
4. Publish the site from Google Sites and add it to Google Search Console.
