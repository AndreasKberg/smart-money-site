        <li><strong>Track your spending for a month.</strong> Keep receipts or notes for everything you spend and separate Needs vs Wants.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a simple formula (50/30/20).</strong> Aim for roughly 50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings/goals.</li>
        <li><strong>Write down your budget.</strong> Use a spreadsheet or notebook and list income, expenses, and savings goals.</li>
        <li><strong>Review and adjust monthly.</strong> Check statements and tweak categories as needed.</li>
